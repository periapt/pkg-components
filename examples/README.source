This package is built using pkg-components. To download current
and latest upstream tarballs see the uscan-components script in that
package.

Note also that the binary copyright file is a merger of 
debian/components/copyright.in and debian/components/*/copyright.
Various Debian tools require a static file in debian/copyright.
If for some reason the generated copyright file changes
copy from debian/$PACKAGE.copyright to debian/copyright after a build.
